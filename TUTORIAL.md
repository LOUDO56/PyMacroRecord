# Save, Load and clear a record
To save a record, you can do `ctrl + s` or by clicking on `File` and `Save` or `Save as` and it will open a file explorer (if you haven't already saved yet).
From there you can choose you favorite path to save your record. You can either save it by `.pmr` extension (recommended) or by `.json` extension.

To load a record, you have two possibilities.
1. Open the a `.pmr` file
2. In the software, do `ctrl + l` or click on `File` and `Load` and it will open a file explorer.\
From there, choose the record you want to play (json and `.pmr` files only)

Finally, to start a new record and delete the last one, you can do `ctrl + n` or by clicking on `File` and `New`.
And you'll have the software as if you were opening it for the first time.
